                <ul>
                	<li>Artificial Intelligence(AI) is the intelligence of machines or software, as opposed to the intelligence of humans or animals. It is also the field of study in computer science that develops and studies intelligent machines. "AI" may also refer to the machines themselves. AI is the backbone of innovation in modern computing, unlocking value for individuals and businesses.</li>
                 <br><br>
                    <li>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a set of technologies that enable computers to perform a variety of advanced functions, including the ability to see, understand and translate spoken and written language, analyze data, make recommendations, and more. For example, optical character recognition (OCR) uses AI to extract text and data from images and documents, turns unstructured content into business-ready structured data, and unlocks valuable insights.</li>
                 <br><br>
                    <li>Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence by software-coded heuristics. Nowadays this code is prevalent in everything from cloud-based, enterprise applications to consumer apps and even embedded firmware. The goal for AI is to be able to do things such as recognize patterns, make decisions, and judge like humans.</li>

                <ul>
                	<li>Artificial Intelligence is a field of science concerned with building computers and machines that can reason, learn, and act in such a way that would normally require human intelligence or that involves data whose scale exceeds what humans can analyze.</li>                        
                    <br><br>
                    <li>AI is a broad field that encompasses many different disciplines, including computer science, data analytics and statistics, hardware and software engineering, linguistics, neuroscience, and even philosophy and psychology.</li>
                    <br><br>
                    <li>On an operational level for business use, AI is a set of technologies that are based primarily on machine learning and deep learning, used for data analytics, predictions and forecasting, object categorization, natural language processing, recommendations, intelligent data retrieval, and more.</li>

                	Artificial intelligence can be organized in several ways, depending on stages of development or actions being performed.

 					For instance, four stages of AI development are commonly recognized.

                	<h1><b>Reactive machines:</b></h1>
                            Limited AI that only reacts to different kinds of stimuli based on preprogrammed rules. Does not use memory and thus cannot learn with new data. IBM’s Deep Blue that beat chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997 was an example of a reactive machine.
                   <br><br>
                   <h1><b>Limited memory:</b></h1>
                            Most modern AI is considered to be limited memory. It can use memory to improve over time by being trained with new data, typically through an artificial neural network or other training model. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, is considered limited memory artificial intelligence.
                            <br><br>
                    <h1><b>Theory of mind:</b></h1>
                            Theory of mind AI does not currently exist, but research is ongoing into its possibilities. It describes AI that can emulate the human mind and has decision-making capabilities equal to that of a human, including recognizing and remembering emotions and reacting in social situations as a human would. 
                            <br><br>
                    <h1><b>Self aware:</b></h1>
                             A step above theory of mind AI, self-aware AI describes a mythical machine that is aware of its own existence and has the intellectual and emotional capabilities of a human. Like theory of mind AI, self-aware AI does not currently exist.

                   Benefits of Artificial Intelligence:
               </header>
               <p>
                  <h3>Automation:</h3>
                     <br>
                        AI can automate workflows and processes or work independently and autonomously from a human team. For example, AI can help automate aspects of cybersecurity by continuously monitoring and analyzing network traffic. Similarly, a smart factory may have dozens of different kinds of AI in use, such as robots using computer vision to navigate the factory floor or to inspect products for defects, create digital twins, or use real-time analytics to measure efficiency and output. 
                  <br><br>
                  <h3>Reduce human error:</h3>
                  <br>
                        AI can eliminate manual errors in data processing, analytics, assembly in manufacturing, and other tasks through automation and algorithms that follow the same processes every single time. 
                  <br><br>
                  <h3>Eliminate repetitive tasks:</h3>
                  <br>
                        AI can be used to perform repetitive tasks, freeing human capital to work on higher impact problems. AI can be used to automate processes, like verifying documents, transcribing phone calls, or answering simple customer questions like “what time do you close?” Robots are often used to perform “dull, dirty, or dangerous” tasks in the place of a human. 
                  <br><br>
                  <h3>Fast and accurate:</h3>
                  <br>
                        AI can process more information more quickly than a human, finding patterns and discovering relationships in data that a human may miss.
                  <br><br>
                  <h3>Infinite availability:</h3>
                  <br>
                        AI is not limited by time of day, the need for breaks, or other human encumbrances. When running in the cloud, AI and machine learning can be “always on,” continuously working on its assigned tasks. 
                   <br><br>
                   <h3>Accelerated research and development:</h3>
                   <br>
                        The ability to analyze vast amounts of data quickly can lead to accelerated breakthroughs in research and development. For instance, AI has been used in predictive modeling of potential new pharmaceutical treatments, or to quantify the human genome.
